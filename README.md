# SERÅ  Projektni Teden / *Project Week*

## Assignment:

Create a mobile app that **helps** to solve one of the following issues:
* poverty
* inequality
* climate change
* degradation of nature
* peace
* justice

## Website

The website was made as a **tool** to present the **idea, team, work process and the app itself** 
to the teachers, judges, and other teams.

Most of the work on the website was done by [Nejc](https://github.com/nkonjicek),\the website's 
repository can be found [here](https://github.com/nkonjicek/nkonjicek.github.io).

# The App

The app was solely developed by [**me**](https://github.com/RenePotocnik) over a span of 5 days.\
The app would have had more features and would be more polished if I had more time,\but I am quite
happy with how it came out, especially as it was my **first time** developing a mobile app, let 
alone using flutter or dart.

The `.apk` file to download the app can be found in the 
[**release**](https://github.com/RenePotocnik/sers-projektni-teden/releases/tag/v1.1) 
(android only).
